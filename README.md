In the never ending challenge for network breach and loss of sensitive and confidential data, Maintaining the log of network traffic data and analysing it with optimal tools are crucial task, this project aims to analyse and find the malicisous activity from the network data, I have used KDD NSL dataset which is a standard and benchmark data of network traffic informations. This has around 42 features describing the extensive parameters of a network communication. with this data I carried out a Decsion tree machine Learning algorithm, RFE (recursive feature engineering ) for the data preprocessing.
The accuracy of detecting the anamoly or malicious activity is 99% for this model. The accuracy F score is calculated by statistical methods.
